## Variables in C

Variables are the name of the memory location where data is stored .

---
 ## For instance,
        a=5,b='Programming '
<p>Here a is storing the value 5 [a integer] in the memory and b is storing "Programming" [a character]. We have basically supposed that in the memory , b is the place where we will have our string 'Programmiing'</p>

## Rules to define Variables
a. Variables are case sensitive. C-programming is itself case sensitive which means lowercase and uppercase is different in C 
**For instance**
```c
    int A=5;
    int a=5;
```
 Both has different memory location

b.The first character of the variable should be alphabet or '_'
```c
    int name='Samyog';
    float _age=18;
```

c. There should not be comma or blank space between the variables.

```c
    int roll,no=36; //will be error
    int roll_no=36; //will be correct
```

d.No other symbol other than '_' should be used.You cannot use '/,`.~.@' or any other symbol in place of '_' .
