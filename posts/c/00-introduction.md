## 🌱 What is C?

**C** is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by **Dennis Ritchie** at Bell Labs. It was originally created to develop the UNIX operating system, and it quickly became the foundation for many modern languages including C++, Java, and Python.

## 🔥 Why Learn C?

Here’s why C is worth your time:

- 🧠 **Deep understanding of how computers work** (memory, CPU, etc.)
- ⚡ **Extremely fast and efficient**
- 🏗️ **Foundation for modern languages like C++, Rust, Go**
- 📦 **Used in system-level programming** (OS, embedded systems)
- 🎓 **Great for learning data structures and algorithms**

## 🚀 Sample Hello World

Here’s your very first C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
